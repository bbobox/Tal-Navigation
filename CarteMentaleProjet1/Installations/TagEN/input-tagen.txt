JV: Botaniwocky Jabberwocky Variations Home : Parodies : Botaniwocky Botaniwocky Peter Cole 'Twas Byblis and the sepal traps did gland and grumous in the whorl All motile were the bladderworts and the monstrose unfurled Beware the involute my son The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! Beware the gibberelin, shun the fulgid ringent bract He took his falcate sword in hand: Long time the midrib foe he sought So rested he by the terete tree, And stood awhile in thought. And as in uncate thought he stood, The involute, with eyes of flame, Came noddling through the torose wood, And bullate as it came! One, two! One, two! And through and through The vasculate went snicker-snack! He left it dead, and with its head He went glabrescent back. And hast thou slain the Involute? Come to my arms, my basal boy! O furcate day! Cauline! Caudate! He chortled in his joy. 'Twas Byblis and the sepal traps did gland and grumous in the whorl All motile were the bladderworts and the monstrose unfurled © Peter Cole 1998.
